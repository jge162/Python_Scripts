**Scripts to help you get through your day faster.**

# Initial setup:

After downloading the repo, open the zip folder and use your
prefered IDE. I personally used [PyCharm.](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac) 

After that you need to find the file path for you 
folder and update it **Accordingly.**

# Supported systems:

Also note: Codes are setup to run on `Mac OSX (supported_system != PC || Linux)`

# Time to run the scripts:

Lastly, you can open a terminal window on your Mac and run `sudo python3 Master_Script.py`

Or alternatively, you can just run `python3 Master_script.py` to execute all desired scripts in one 
command line entry in terminal PyCharm too.
