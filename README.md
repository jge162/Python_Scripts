Scripts to help you get through your day faster!

After downloading the repo, open the zip folder and use your
prefered IDE -> `I used PyCharm` 

After that you need to find the file path for you 
folder and update it **accordingly.**

Also note: Codes are setup to run on Mac osx builds (not PC)!

Lastly, you can open a terminal window on your Mac and run `sudo python3 Master_script.py`

Or alternatively, you can just run `python3 Master_script.py` to execute all desired scripts in one 
command line entry in terminal PyCharm too.
